This directory is intended for project specific (private) libraries.

PlatformIO will compile them to static libraries and link into executable file.

The source code of each library should be placed in a separate directory
("lib/your_library_name/[here are source files]").

For example, see the structure of the TFT_eSPI_Config library in this project.
